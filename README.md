# Pima Indians Diabetes Classification with MLP

This project demonstrates a binary classification task on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The objective is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical data.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which is publicly available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pima+indians+diabetes).

## ðŸ§ª Experiments

The project is split across three notebooks to evaluate the effect of different techniques:

1. **Notebook 1**: Baseline MLP without L2 regularization and without the ADAM optimizer.
2. **Notebook 2**: MLP with L2 regularization.
3. **Notebook 3**: MLP with both L2 regularization and ADAM optimizer.
